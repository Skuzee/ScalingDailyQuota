# Scaling Daily Quota
This Lethal Company mod scales the quota depending on the number of players connected, and increases the quota daily. Each finished quota cycle increases the difficulty. The idea is, as long as each player gets their daily quota in scrap, the game will continue.  
  
Example with 3 players:  
Quota Day 1: 100 x 3 = 300  
Quota Day 2: +100 x 3 = 600  
Quota Day 3: +100 x 3 = 900  
DEADLINE: 900  
Quota Day 1: +125 x 3 = 1275  
Quota Day 2: +125 x 3 = 1650  
Quota Day 3: +125 x 3 = 2025  
DEADLINE: 2025
